<h2>La La Bakies Is Baking In The House</h2>

<p>Dan Liu March 19</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Michelle@2x.jpg"/></p>

<p><strong>Michelle</strong> is the magician behind the refreshingly delicious gluten-free, diary-free, soy-free, non-genetically-modified baked sweets, if that&#39;s your thing.</p>

<p>But the real deal here is the artistry in sourcing ingredients from scratch and bringing out the best of nature through merely applying heat, think local carrots and pupkins, organic dark choc and spices. That&#39;s how Yancey approaches coffee, start with the freshest and strongest beans and pull the shots with veteran expertise.</p>

<p>Her <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2074574548/la-la-bakies-a-vegan-and-gluten-free-alternative-b">kickstarter</a> campaign for achiving allergy-free bakies just concluded last december</p>

<p>Dan Liu March 10</p>

<p><strong>Tonx Coffee</strong> is a Yancey-approved LA roaster that only ships to individual customers. </p>

<p>Like Yancey, the Tonx brothers believe in good beans and fresh roasts over gear. So for those who don&#39;t have enough access to Yancey&#39;s espresso pulls nor beans, sign up for Tonx! I recommend <a href="#">Aeropress</a> and the <a href="#">Hario mini mill</a> to make the coffee. Rest assured neither of them is &#39;gear&#39; as they don&#39;t have glass parts.</p>

<h2>The Secretly Underground Project</h2>

<p>Yancey Q Feb 20</p>

<p><strong>Friends</strong>, you have been and are the greatest thing to exist east of the LA River aka NELA. </p>

<p>We are calling all artist interested in showcasing in the up and coming Cypress Village underground tunnel art walk to send us a brief Bio of their work and why they would love to exhibit. </p>

<p>Also we are now taking request for art curators, here&#39;s the catch...we will be paying out a small decent stipend to all curators selected in this process. Please send your bio to yahoo email: antiguacoffeehouse. Either say (artist) or (curator) in the subject line.This is going to be the biggest thing to happen in the NELA since Teddy Roosevelt rode the street cars up Figueroa just about 100 years ago! The Espresso Revolution &quot;Creates&quot;...have a great day people&#39;s</p>

<p>Dan Liu Jan 09</p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;What I tell patients is, if you like coffee, go ahead and drink as much as you want and can,&quot; </p></blockquote>

<p>This is where coffee differs from wine. Coffee has the <em>real</em> stuff that improves your day.</p>
