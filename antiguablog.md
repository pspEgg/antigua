**Michelle** *is* the magician behind the refreshingly delicious gluten-free, diary-free, soy-free, non-genetically-modified bakies, if that's your thing.

But the real deal here is the artistry in sourcing ingredients from scratch and bringing out the best of nature through merely applying heat, think local carrots and pupkins, organic dark choc and spices.

**Tonx Coffee** is a Yancey-approved LA roaster that only ships to individual customers. 

Like Yancey, the Tonx brothers believe in good beans and fresh roasts over gear. So for those who don't have enough access to Yancey's espresso pulls nor beans, sign up for Tonx! I recommend [Aeropress](#) and the [Hario mini mill](#) to make the coffee. Rest assured neither of them is 'gear' as they don't have glass parts.

This is where coffee differs from wine. Coffee has the *real* stuff that improves your day.
