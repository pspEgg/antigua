Easy, pick a domain name at http://www.gandi.net (antigua.la is available) and I can set up the design you saw on a tumblr blog in an hour. There is a tumblr iPad app from which you can post from (or just email posts).

And yes, you need a facebook page, probably more than a blog. Most people get updates, share and interact within facebook(and twitter and pinterest and instagram). In that sense a tumblr blog probably won't be much value(although tumblr has its own social network, it's a different crowd).

However on websites you have full control over the visitors' experience. You can write better articles and send them out as weekly newsletters. You can accept payments directly on the site with 2% transaction fees. All these are already implemented on http://pspegg.co/antigua. (did you check out all the stuff I packed in?)

What do you think? going forward from here would be a lot of work, but I'm ready to start now. If you are too see here: http://pspegg.com - I thought of a simple way to finish this project.

Now that you've seen my version of the website functionalities, tell me yours! I have a lot of design experience from graphics to scripting.

P.S.

I love the atmosphere at Austin, Texas - I get a lot of work done here. The downside is I have to mail order Tonx and make coffee myself. The local ones get roasts from all over US but they are often stale. I haven't decided when to go back yet.
