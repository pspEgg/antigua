Love this project. Reminds me of Jane Jacobs's comments about how debilitating "border vacuums" and unused spaces can be to city life. Reclaiming this in this way is awesome. And I love to see the energy of multiple projects feeding each other: the tunnels, arts, biking, river conservation, pedestrianism, rethinking transportation, and, mostly, getting people in a community to know each other better, to hang out, to grow together and serve one another. I live on North Fig near the Annandale Elem School tunnel, but I'm not sure it's used any longer, either. Be great to see this take off! Patrick

Love the positive ambition of this community project. Even better that it combines the arts and commerce in a creative and dynamic way!!!

The imagination, and creativity, that has inspired this project can be a model for everyone who refuses to succomb to the commercialization of every aspect of this society. What? they're not building a strip mall? Another "Galleria." Instead, an art space which the community can celebrate and take part in. Antigua Corree House has been a beacon and magnet for thoughtful, creative people...Of course they would be the ones to anchor this idea. This is the kind of initiative that the Revolution will unleash in an even greater way. Let's be working toward that day... and make this a contribution to hastening that Revolutionary future. To quote another entry;... Go YancEy!!

This project is really for the children of Cypress Park, they are not as luck as other areas in Los Angeles. Antigua Coffee House has the most beautiful Mural in The Northeast and these children look at it everyday they go to school and they go home. Thank you guys for such a great production and now you want to convert the old tunnel into a gallery, you guys rock! They kids will be blessed with more art instead of the Gang Crap up in Highland Park. I support your project and hopefully you win the grant but realistically you have a ton of non profits running against you. Good Luck! and just maybe it can happen.

After reading some of the proposals on the competition I decided to vote for Antigua Coffee House. They have a unique project and it appears to me they are do-ers, shakers and movers. I have been living in Cypress park for 40 years and honestly the last 3 years have been the most enjoyed years. **This little Cafe I believe is the main reason why our community is growing and why the neighborhood is feeling safer. I can actually finally walk my dog at night, past by the coffee shop and admire the art on the walls**. They dont have security bars on their windows and the mural on the outside wall never gets tagged and now the underground ground tunnel art gallery, what an excellent concept. Just imagine every unused tunnel in the city becoming some sort of art space. Hopefully they win and if not i will volunteer to help it get going, after all yancey has started something increible. On the other hand, most of the proposals i have read are Westside entries, now who are you kidding! The westside has everything and here you go with our little Cypress Park having Nothing, well at least one thing's for sure we have our families and our risk takers and believe me Antigua Coffee House is a Giant!

Antigua Cultural Coffee House is a Los Angeles GEM. <3 Yancey and his crew are amazing - humble and extremely friendly, too. :) Not only do they make delicious edibles, drinks and of course, CAFE, but they also have shown the community of Cypress Park that they care about it and the ARTS. They always feature local and community based artists in their house with a "gallery type display," make generous donations, and spread the word about other events happening in the community. I'm sure they do a lot more! They deserve this win! They have the energy and all the ambition in the world to make a difference and I think they are the one's to achieve this AMAZING PROJECT. Underground walkway art galleries in LA?!?! C'mon! Who doesn't wan't that?!

http://highlandpark-ca.patch.com/articles/antigua-owner-sees-shop-as-cultural-hub I read this article on the Antigua Coffee Coffee in Cypress Park and was intrigued on such progress this business has in that community. So I decided to enter and see what they are all about and to my surprise these guys are true. they really do care about the neighborhood, what made me vote for them was the fact that they are real people making a huge difference in this town. **Cypress Park does not have the commodities like the westside of our city, they don't even have a single Non Profit representing the arts.** While I was there the owner was helping one of the students from the middle school across the street with some algebra, that dude is awesome. It just seems to me that he has pour his heart deeply into this little special community and his plan to convert the tunnel into a Gallery is probably a great idea. He has the will and i know he will make it happen, even if he does not will the grand prize. I can see this community pitching in funds to get it going, **Cypress Park used to be a gang town and now its a great town. Thank you dude!**

This is a good thing for our neighborhood and our community. Yanci and his family take pride in their shop and the street it's on we need more people like them in our neighborhood

This project, devolped by a Cypress Park born community member and designed to help younger Cypress Park community members, gets my vote because it is for our local improvement. I have lived and still live in Cypress Park and I know that the coffeehouse has become an important community hangout. If this project can bring hope and opportunity to more Latina/o youth in our community and in the Eastside, and also help build community, then this will have been money well spend.

Great community cafe, where you can relax enjoy the weather, food,drinks and the people!!! We need the art in our community to show case how out the box we are as the city of Los Angeles. We have a lot of street art and it would be great to keep here and let our youth and look forward to a future in their own community.

I have lived a zip line's trip above Antigua Coffee House (on the other side of the junior high) for more than 7 years. In that time I have seen the neighborhood change a lot, as older generations and extended families have been replaced by landlords and younger tenants. While I know change is inevitable, I think it would be a shame for the area to lose its ties to the past in an effort to raise property values. Yancey is the best of both worlds -- able to bring high-quality business and a strong sense of history to the Figueroa corridor. His desire to complement his for-profit coffee shop with the art gallery and open space is exactly what Cypress Park needs to launch its growth along the same lines that York Boulevard in Highland Park has grown . . . but with more for the kids! The fact that this art space is adjacent to an LAUSD junior high is HUGE. Giving children that age a chance to see art made by people like them right in their neighborhood, in a funky space with a spotty past, will open up so many avenues for exploration just when their cultural values are being shaped. Through people like Yancey and projects like this, we can make sure that the LA of 2050 keeps its roots in the traditions and communities that founded and maintain the beating heart of the city, and flowers into a bright garden of opportunity for generations to come.

I have been coming to Antigua Coffee house since its induction in El Sereno in 2005. Not only is the owner Yancey a fun and welcoming sight to see, his products are exceptional. The coffee is delicious in flavor and boldness. He roasts his own coffee! They recently started making gluten free products which are scrumptious. i enjoy stopping in either in the morning on my way to work or anytime of day. My favorite coffee shop. He also makes a "green tea latte" that is sugar free and made fresh with brewed tea bags.....not a sugar filled powder. Sandwiches are also pretty tasty. Ambience is great as well! Come visit and relax for a moment....

This proposal is a community oriented grassroots project that embodies the essence and potential of Los Angeles. The underground pedestrian walkway which runs under Figueroa St. is currently locked up and disregarded, but similar to many spaces all throughout Los Angeles, has the potential to be a local creative space for the friends, neighbors, and residents of North East Los Angeles. The monthly Tunnel Art Walk would not only utilize a space that was initially intended for the public, but also create a diverse and welcoming environment for Angelenos from all walks of life. Yancey Quinones, the owner of Antigua Coffee and creative mind behind the Tunnel Art Walk, has consistenly shown dedication and commitment to the arts and a progressive vision to revitalize a neighborhood that has long been neglected. As a native of Cypress Park, Yancey understands and acknowledges the history of Los Angeles, maintaining connections with the local community (including schools, the city council, small businesses, non-profits, etc). Everyday Antigua Coffee opens it doors, attracting a diverse group of customers, such as musicians, writers, artists, etc. as well as long term residents and locals of different ages, ethnic backgrounds, and interests to converse, share ideas and stories. This project would not only expand upon a wonderful cultural center that already exists, but also change the current landscape of Cypress Park and the overall potential for a thriving arts district in North East Los Angeles that supports diversity and community.

I arrived to Los Angeles from Brazil in late 2004, I worked in the west side of Los Angeles and then moved to Mt Washington on the East Side in late 2009. That is when I ran into this nice progressive Cafe and since then have been a loyal customer. The owner is kind and a true community warrior who has deep roots in Cypress park and a solid compassionate heart. I have seen this community grow and with that said I am witness to the good work this coffeehouse is doing in this astounding neighborhood. Thank You.

I remember passing by Cypress Park in my high school years. I recently saw a drastic change along the neighborhood of Antigua Coffee Shop. This project is a good way to reuse empty space and spread the artistic minds of the area and give them confidence to create and not think that only known artists are essential to the city of Los Angeles. I am looking forward to the days of art events in Cypress Park

This would be an excellent project to bring to fruition. The Northeast Los Angeles communities are is rich in culture and arts and we need a place to showcase all of this. The tunnels in LA have almost all been shut down due to crime but this would be the perfect project to not only create a postiive use for them but it would also create a permanent home for the artwork of our local artists. Our neighborhood could truly benefit from this.

Let's expand the artistic showcase of LA artist to Cypress Park. The area around Downtown LA is screaming in art and this project will give artist the opportunity to interact with their peers. Cypress Park has been invaded by tourist lately and it will only become more and an extension of the art scene of Los Angeles. What better way to do this than take advantage of this tunnel and put it to a great use. I hope this project becomes reality.

I first visited Los Angeles about 7 years ago and I was introduced to Antigua Cultural Coffeehouse because a friend of mine was having an art show. Since then I have decided to call Cypress Park home and Antigua Coffee shop (the only coffee shop in town) home as well. I have been impressed ever since by the community involvement and the impact they have on people of all ages, and races. Funds are greatly needed to get resources that will improve Cypress Park, my new home. Keep up the good work Antigua.

I remember as a young kid walking down this neighborhood when all you found were gang bangers hanging around and drug paraphernalia laying in the streets and particularly in the tunnel. All I can say is that we have come a long way, but there is still a lot more work to do. The plans to improve this neighborhood are about time. Now, is the time to create this change that will live on forever in the minds of youth who walk to Loreto Elementary or to Nightingale Jr. High. Youth who will find inspiration in the arts instead of gangs. It is exciting to learn that there is a possibility that Cypress Park will become a leader of change and this is exactly what makes one take ownership of communities and you will see that with this seed planted others will follow.

*After years and years of neglect, it became obvious that local individuals would have to take up ownership in the business corridor and improve our own community. In 2007 I signed the lease and began the Coffeehouse endeavor, bumps on the road from Building and Safety and the county health department. After, 2 years we were finally able to open its doors to the community and this lovely neighborhood of Cypress Park took us in with a warm welcoming. Soon, people began to install planters and help sweep the sidewalk, then a local non profit (LA Works.org) commission a mural and the Espresso Revolution was on its way. Antigua Coffee House is NOT a fantasy its a true Reality of this Town and everyday it grows in a sustainable melting pot. Thank You Community for believing in Us and thank you for this Great Marketing Opportunity, "all eyes on us". We already Won your hearts and just maybe this little giant will overcome all its obstacles and prove to the world that Community For Profits are as cool as Neighborhood Non-Profits when we work together! The Espresso Revolution Salutes You! and all the insurgents on the trail.*

Antigua Coffee is that special place in the community where different demographics from the community come together and meet. It has the unique charm where you came meet your local City Councilmember, local police officer, your mailman, and your neighbors by just getting a cup of coffee. People you normally don’t have the time to speak with you can, and it builds a true sense of belonging to the community. Yancey the store owner has made it a true community center where people feel at home and make the coffee house apart of their daily routine. Cypress Park is a struggling community, and the Tunnel Art Walk is an actual event that hopefully people will make part of their lives like the coffee shop is part of their daily routine. We all need to feel proud of the community we live in, and this is one more positive step in the right direction.

This is what a grass roots economic and cultural development project looks like and it will do more for our boulevard than any of the high-handed efforts of past generations to "improve" the area with strip mall businesses, parking lots, and freeway style streets. This project gets right down to the street level and makes a positive difference.

I've lived in Cypress Park all my life, since Antigua Coffee House opened its doors in late 2009, this community has changed. The owner is a local resident who took the risk of investing in the neighborhood and wow! has it paid off. They invest in quality and in the arts, you should see their art gallery shows, its crowded! I am casting my vote for Antigua Coffee, local business do the right thing.
