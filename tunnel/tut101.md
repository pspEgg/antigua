## Want to write something for this page?

We start by writing a standard text file into the ubiquitous online folder.

Because the folder can be access from anywhere, and that everything understands *the* standard text file, your options are **unlimited**. This is what standard text looks like:

This is called Markdown, the "`##`" means a level 2 heading(h2). the title of this page you see now is prefixed with a "`#`", a top level heading(h1). On the web people agreed to structure their text this way. The designer then comes in and says "I want h2 to be uppercase, bold and huge."

For this site I designed emphasized texts like "`*the*`" to be "*the*" and strong texts like "`**unlimited**`" to be "**unlimited**".

Note that only by separating text with an empty line can you create a paragraph. In this design, the first paragraph is larger in text (if it's not an image). That's a design decision I made.

Markdown is designed to make writing fun! Let's get started, *pull out your iPad*.
